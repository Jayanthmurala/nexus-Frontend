# API Routes Changes Documentation

## Overview
Documentation of all API route modifications during NextAuth integration and reversion process.

## Modified API Routes

### 1. Network Users API (`/api/network/users`)

#### Original Implementation
```typescript
// Simple token validation
const token = request.headers.get("authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");
if (!token) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}

// Mock user creation
const user = {
  id: Date.now().toString(),
  name, email, role,
  collegeId: collegeId || null,
  department: department || null,
  year: year || null,
};
```

#### NextAuth Integration (Reverted)
- Used `getServerSession(authOptions)` for authentication
- Implemented role-based access control for admin-only operations
- Integrated with Prisma client for database operations
- Added proper user creation with database persistence

### 2. User Profile API (`/api/network/users/[userId]`)

#### Original Implementation
```typescript
// Token validation from headers
const token = request.headers.get("authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");

// Mock user data responses
const user = {
  id: params.userId,
  name: "Mock User",
  email: "user@example.com",
  // ... other mock fields
};
```

#### NextAuth Integration (Reverted)
- Session-based authentication with user role validation
- Database queries with Prisma for real user data
- Proper CRUD operations with data persistence
- Role-based authorization (users can edit own profiles, admins can edit any)

### 3. Upload Media API (`/api/uploadmedia`)

#### Original Implementation
```typescript
// Local file storage
const uploadsDir = join(process.cwd(), "public/uploads");
await writeFile(path, buffer);

// Return local file URL
const fileUrl = `/uploads/${filename}`;
```

#### NextAuth Integration (Reverted)
- Cloudinary cloud storage integration
- Advanced file type validation and size limits
- Folder-based organization (user_avatars, resumes, project_images, etc.)
- Secure upload with proper authentication

## Authentication Patterns

### Original Pattern (Restored)
```typescript
// Check for token in headers
const token = request.headers.get("authorization")?.replace("Bearer ", "");
if (!token) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}

// TODO: Verify token with auth service
// For now, assume token is valid
```

### NextAuth Pattern (Removed)
```typescript
// Session-based authentication
const session = await getServerSession(authOptions);
if (!session) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Unauthorized" }, { status: 401 });
}

// Role-based access control
const userRole = (session as any).user?.role;
if (!["head_admin", "dept_admin"].includes(userRole)) {
  return NextResponse.json({ error: "Forbidden" }, { status: 403 });
}
```

## Database Integration (Removed)

### Prisma Operations That Were Removed
- User CRUD operations
- College and department relationships
- Project and badge associations
- File upload metadata storage

### Mock Data Restored
All API routes now return mock data for development purposes until proper backend integration is implemented.

## File Upload Changes

### Local Storage (Restored)
- Files saved to `public/uploads/` directory
- Simple timestamp-based filename generation
- Basic file type and size validation

### Cloudinary Integration (Removed)
- Cloud-based file storage
- Advanced image optimization
- Folder-based organization
- CDN delivery with secure URLs

## Security Considerations

### Current State (After Reversion)
- Basic token presence validation
- No role-based access control at API level
- Local file storage without advanced security
- Mock data responses

### Removed Security Features
- Proper session validation
- Role-based route protection
- File type whitelisting
- Size limit enforcement
- Secure cloud storage

## Next Steps for Proper Implementation
1. Implement proper token verification with backend auth service
2. Add role-based access control at API level
3. Integrate with actual database for data persistence
4. Implement secure file upload with proper validation
5. Add proper error handling and logging
