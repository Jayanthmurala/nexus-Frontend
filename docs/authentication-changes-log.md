# Authentication Changes Documentation

## Overview
This document logs all the authentication-related changes that were made to the Nexus platform during the NextAuth integration attempt and subsequent reversion.

## Changes Made During NextAuth Integration

### 1. Middleware Changes (`src/middleware.ts`)
**Original**: Simple token-based authentication checking `authorization` header or `accessToken` cookie
**Modified**: NextAuth `withAuth` middleware with role-based route protection
**Reverted**: Back to simple token validation

### 2. AuthOptions Configuration (`src/lib/authOptions.ts`)
**Original**: Did not exist (using custom auth system)
**Modified**: Created NextAuth configuration with:
- Credentials provider for email/password login
- JWT strategy with custom callbacks
- Session handling with user role management
**Reverted**: File should be removed/restored to original state

### 3. Login Page (`src/app/login/page.tsx`)
**Original**: Custom login form with AuthContext
**Modified**: NextAuth signIn integration with OAuth providers
**Reverted**: Back to custom AuthContext login

### 4. Dashboard Component (`src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx`)
**Original**: Used AuthContext for user role detection
**Modified**: NextAuth session-based role detection
**Reverted**: Back to AuthContext usage

### 5. API Routes Authentication

#### Network Users API (`src/app/api/network/users/route.ts`)
**Original**: Simple token validation from headers
**Modified**: NextAuth `getServerSession` with role-based access control
**Reverted**: Back to token header validation

#### User Profile API (`src/app/api/network/users/[userId]/route.ts`)
**Original**: Token-based auth with mock data
**Modified**: NextAuth session with Prisma database integration
**Reverted**: Back to token validation with mock responses

#### Upload Media API (`src/app/api/uploadmedia/route.ts`)
**Original**: Local file upload with token validation
**Modified**: Cloudinary integration with NextAuth session
**Reverted**: Back to local file storage with token auth

### 6. Client Layout (`src/components/layout/ClientLayout.tsx`)
**Original**: AuthContext-based authentication state
**Modified**: NextAuth SessionProvider integration
**Reverted**: Back to AuthContext usage

## Database Dependencies Removed
- Removed Prisma client usage from API routes
- Eliminated database queries that required schema setup
- Restored mock data responses for development

## External Service Dependencies Removed
- Removed Cloudinary integration
- Eliminated NextAuth OAuth provider dependencies
- Restored local file storage for uploads

## Authentication Flow Restored
1. **Login**: Direct API call to backend auth service
2. **Token Storage**: localStorage-based token management
3. **Route Protection**: Middleware checks for token presence
4. **API Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header
5. **Role Management**: Handled by AuthContext from backend user data

## Files That Need Complete Reversion
- `src/lib/authOptions.ts` - Should be removed or restored to original
- `src/app/login/page.tsx` - Revert to AuthContext implementation
- `src/components/Dashboard/Dashboard.tsx` - Restore AuthContext usage
- Any remaining NextAuth API routes

## Recommended Next Steps
1. Remove NextAuth dependencies from package.json
2. Clean up any remaining NextAuth configuration files
3. Ensure all authentication flows use the original AuthContext system
4. Test login/logout functionality with backend services
5. Verify role-based route protection works with original middleware

## Notes
- The backend auth service (port 4001) should handle all authentication logic
- Frontend should only manage token storage and API calls
- Role-based access control should be enforced by backend APIs
- No database schema changes were made during this process
